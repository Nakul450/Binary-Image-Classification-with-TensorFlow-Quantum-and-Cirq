# Binary-Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow-Quantum-and-Cirq
This project demonstrates a hybrid quantum-classical neural network designed using TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ) and Cirq. The model is trained to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using quantum circuits as feature extractors.

# âœ¨ Project Highlights
âœ… Implements Quantum Data Encoding using qubit rotations

ðŸ§© Uses entangling gates (XX, ZZ, CZ, CNOT) to extract high-dimensional features

ðŸ§  Combines classical neural networks with quantum layers for hybrid learning

ðŸŽ¯ Trained on Fashion MNIST with competitive accuracy

ðŸ“ˆ Includes performance tracking and accuracy comparison with classical baselines
